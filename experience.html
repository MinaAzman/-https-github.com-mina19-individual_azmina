<h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
<div>As for experience, I don't really know what to tell. But, I want to share my most memorable experience which is when I did my Umrah. I did Umrah with my family when I was 13 years old. From KLIA, we landed to Medina Airport. It was 12 a.m when we reached there and from the airport and there are busses that are already waiting for us. We took the bus to go to our hotel and rest before Subuh prayer. That Subuh prayer was my first time prayer that I pray at Masjid Nabawi. I was so happy and excited. I also go to pray in Raudhah even it was so crowded with people from around the world. Not to forget, the citizens of Madinah were so friendly with us. After a week there, we have to left Madinah and went to Makkah for Umrah. The Mutawwif in our bus explain a little bit about the history of Makkah. The journey from Madinah to Makkah took almost 8 hours. That time, there no R&R station at all unless a restaurant. It quite struggle for me and the other kids as we cannot go to the toilet for awhile.We reached hotel at Makkah around 12 a.m. We went to our room to put our things and prepare for our Umrah. At 1 a.m, we went to Masjidil Haram to start our Umrah. I was so happy to do my first Sai'e and Tawaf. And also, able to see Kaabah in front of my eyes. It was so magnificent. I feel very glad that I got experience it in my life.</div>
